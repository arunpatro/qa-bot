## about
QuizGen is an AI app to generate quizes from content.

## running locally (web app)
1. First create a `.env` from the `.env.sample` in the `web/api` directory
2. Start the local frontend dev server:
```sh
cd web && npm install
npm run dev
```
3. Start the local backend dev server:
```sh
cd api
uvicorn app:app --reload --port 5000
```

## deploy to vercel
```sh
npm i -g vercel
vercel
```
Connection between the two should be automatic (see `web/vite.config.ts` for proxy config).

## Features

## notes
- https://github.com/dsdanielpark/arxiv2text 
    - not that good
    - math from latex in bad
    - doesn't get subsections
    - need a combo of latex and ai 
- vic pachuri marker-pdf is quite good => takes time, can do a modal inference
